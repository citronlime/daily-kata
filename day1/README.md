Todays project was
1. Design a header in figma with logo and menu with responsive functionality
2. Design made for iphone but implemented as less than 550px because of chrome browser not smaller than 500 to keep it easy
3. The menu will be horizontal on larger screens and vertical on smaller screens
4. The icons for open and close are borrowed from iconify
5. There is javascript for opening and closing the menu on small screens
