1. Todays design was a hamburger menu with icons for open and close and with javascript for the event handling.
2. I struggled a bit with the placement of the menu on small screens. The fixed position of the menu made it difficult to place it correctly.
3. The media query for larger screens I also had some issues with. The ovveride and unset of the styles from mobile first did not behave as expected today.
4. The icons are fron iconify a plugin I used in figma.
