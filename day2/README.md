Todays desin was to create a hamburger menu without javascript for opening and closing the menu
A checkbox is used to determine if the menu should be open or closed.
The checkbox is not displayed, a hamburger menu with three lines will be displayed on top of it
When the checkbopx is checked a menu displayes below it has the same width as the window and the menu items are displyed horizontally.
When the menu is displayed one of the lines is hidden and the other two are rotated to form an x
There is a javascript for displaying the width of the window as an help to determine the breakpoints
